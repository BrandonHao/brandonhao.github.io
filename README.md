## Hi, I'm Brandon Hao

This is my website where I'll be posting my projects. I'll be including project descriptions and pictures.

### Musical Tesla Coil

This was a project I worked on for around 5 months between May and October of 2019. The goal was to design and construct a tesla coil capable of arcing to the environment while playing music. The design is a single resonant solid state tesla coil consisting of a machine wound coil and a top load made from aluminum wire wrapped around a 3D printed shell. It has a resonant frequency of around 160KHz and is capable of generating upwards of 1 million volts from a 30 volt DC supply. The circuit and PCB layout were designed by myself in Altium.

In the process of constructing this project I wound 3 secondary coils, with the first 2 by hand. After the 2nd iteration I realized that hand-wound coils would be too imperfect for this so I put together a jig from an old fixture and a DC motor. This produced the nice coil in the final project

### Chess Robot

I designed and created this robot as part of a team of 3. It was constructed using LEGO Mindstorm Robotics parts for the mechanical setup. The robot mechanically consists of a pick and place claw on a carriage that allowed it to access any piece on the board. The robot was controlled using an external app through Bluetooth. The app would take a picture of the board, analyse it using OpenCV, run the board-state through a home-rolled machine learning algorthim, then send the best calculated move to the NXT brick through Bluetooth which would then move the piece accordingly.
